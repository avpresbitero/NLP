# Sentiment Analysis Using Keras Tensorflow

## The Dataset:

I will be using the tweet dataset from Kaggle called the sentiment140 dataset. This dataset contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api . Tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment. 

Using Keras Tensorflow, I am training the model on a combined convolutional network with 2 bidirectional LSTMs.
